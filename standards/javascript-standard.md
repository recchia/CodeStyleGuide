Javascript Coding Standard
-------------------------

This guide links to [AIRBNB](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
We does not maintain it's own Javascript standards.
Instead, we choose to utilize the well written and founded Airbnb javascript
standards.

The intent of this guide is to reduce cognitive friction when scanning code
from different authors. It does so by enumerating a shared set of rules and
expectations about how to format Javascript code.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).
